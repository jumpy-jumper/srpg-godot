Awakening
	When a character awakens, all other units of the same blessing are retreated, 
	the unit's summoner loses faith every round, and the unit's summoner cannot 
	summon any units or use any skills. When the unit's summoner reaches 0 faith, 
	awakening ends and the unit is retreated. A unit may only awaken once per map.
