Implementation
	Urgent
		Make automatic skills not last for more than one turn
		Portraits are blurry, scale better
		Rearrange Unit UI
		Skills that activate on the next basic attack
		Summoner win skill
		Settings menu
			All the static variables in the game class, + resolution options
		"Slow" game speed, with an option to change it to fast
	Bugs
		Deselect node from menu when window loses focus
		Unit UI shows up even if camera was fiddled with but zoom didn't change
		Follower doesn't preview if you restart after dying
		Enemy tweener can break with fast undo/advance
	Game Logic
		Resolve ties in ally targeting / enemy action
	QoL
		Reimplement unit UI
		Clicking on units inside gates displays their contents
		Gate unit preview displays their skills
		Hovering cursor away from terrain should update cursor, have keyboard jump to nearest available
		Q/E during unit UI moves to the next follower
		Hide clutter in skill description
		Make unit UI more appropriate to each unit
			Don't show terrain on enemies, other stats on non-combat units
		Implement camera follows cursor on keyboard
		Implement intents
	Refactors for performance / code cleanness
		Have mugshot regions somewhere central instead of a unit property
		Consolidate healing and attacking code
		Skill descriptions - use parameters instead of hard values and have a get_description() function
		Implement predictive round logic
		Implement delta state saving		
	Tutorial bubble
		Make skills and statuses reload by instancing a packed scene instead of an empty scene
		Select unit to be summoned
		You can face your units
		Camera movement
		How to win the game
		Your units can block enemy spawns
		Enemy banked movement
		Block range vs attack range
		Right click / shift on units to bring up information
		Player unit targeting priority
		Enemy targeting priority
		Turn order


Testing observations:
	Introduce the attack priority of player units somehow
	East-02
		Easier wave of eyes before the hard wave?
		Make it so you can win even if you activate Natasha's skill early?
		Unclear when Dieck activates his skill, do not understand why he survives
		Managed to clear without consciously baiting out attacks with Natasha
	East-03
		Remove the tiles two columns left of summoner? It allows Fredrick to be deployed later
		Spawn more zombies towards the end to make it so you can't clear with Fredrick?
	East-04
		
	Don't know when a skill is activated
