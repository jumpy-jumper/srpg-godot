Implementation
	Urgent
		Zooming camera anchors to the clicked position and not the middle
		Keyboard rapid fire on undo and advance turn
		Settings menu
		Debug flag to gates recalculating paths every frame
		Summoner win skill
		Clicking on units inside gates displays their contents
		Gate unit preview displays their skills
	Bugs
		Unit UI shows up even if camera was fiddled with but zoom didn't change
		Follower doesn't preview if you restart after dying
		Enemy tweener can break with fast undo/advance
		Cursor rapid fire on keyboard doesn't work at high FPS
	Game Logic
		Should skills deactivate after everything has acted?
		Resolve ties in ally targeting / enemy action
	QoL
		Default camera position and zoom
		Hovering cursor away from terrain should update cursor, have keyboard jump to nearest available
		Q/E during unit UI moves to the next follower
		Hide clutter in skill description
		Make unit UI more appropriate to each unit
			Don't show terrain on enemies, other stats on nomn-combat units
		Implement camera follows cursor on keyboard
		Implement intents
	Refactors for performance / code cleanness
		Have mugshot regions somewhere central instead of a unit property
		Consolidate healing and attacking code
		Skill descriptions - use parameters instead of hard values and have a get_description() function
		Implement predictive round logic
		Implement delta state saving

Testing observations:
	Advancing turn without confirming facing lets you change facing after placing unit
	Introduce the attack priority of player units somehow

		Easier wave of eyes before the hard wave?
		Make it so you can win even if you activate Natasha's skill early?
		Unclear when Dieck activates his skill, do not understand why he survives
	East-03
		Remove the tiles two columns left of summoner? It allows Fredrick to be deployed later
		Spawn more zombies towards the end to make it so you can't clear with Fredrick?
