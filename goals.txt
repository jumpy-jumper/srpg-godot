Implementation
	Controls
		Analog vs digital controls for cursor / camera
	Urgent
		Portraits are blurry, scale better
		Skill icons
		Rearrange Unit UI
		Skills that activate on the next basic attack
		Changing resolution places window in correct monitor
	Bugs
		Cursor vertical movement doesn't rapid fire after horizontal movement
		Deselect node from menu when window loses focus
		Unit UI shows up even if camera was fiddled with but zoom didn't change
		Follower doesn't preview if you restart after dying
		Changing resolution should place the window on the current screen and not screen 0
		Fullscreening with F11 doesn't change the focus in the settings window
	Game Logic
		Resolve ties in ally targeting / enemy action
	QoL
		"Slow" game speed, with an option to change it to fast
		Follower menu on left click
			Retreat
			Activate Skill
		Undo on follower facing cancel
		Multiple rapid fire - increase speed on successive activations of rapid fire
		Menu navigation
			Clear mouse focus when keyboard input happens
			Mouse input should not activate keyboard focus and viceversa
		Clicking on units inside gates displays their contents
		Gate unit preview displays their skills
		Hovering cursor away from terrain should update cursor, have keyboard jump to nearest available
		Q/E during unit UI moves to the next follower
		Hide clutter in skill description
		Make unit UI more appropriate to each unit
			Don't show terrain on enemies, other stats on non-combat units
		Implement camera follows cursor on keyboard
		Implement intents
		When placing a unit, give some frames where releasing the button won't confirm facing
	Refactors for performance / code cleanness
		Have mugshot regions somewhere central instead of a unit property
		Consolidate healing and attacking code
		Skill descriptions - use parameters instead of hard values and have a get_description() function
		Implement predictive round logic
		Implement delta state saving		
	Tutorial bubble
		Make skills and statuses reload by instancing a packed scene instead of an empty scene
		Select unit to be summoned
		You can face your units
		Camera movement
		How to win the game
		Your units can block enemy spawns
		Enemy banked movement
		Block range vs attack range
		Right click / shift on units to bring up information
		Player unit targeting priority
		Enemy targeting priority
		Turn order


Testing observations:
	Introduce the attack priority of player units somehow
	Don't know when a skill is activated
