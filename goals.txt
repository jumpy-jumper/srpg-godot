	World map
Implementation
	Urgent
		Zooming camera anchors to the clicked position and not the middle
		Keyboard rapid fire on undo and advance turn
		Settings menu
		Summoner win skill
		Clicking on units inside gates displays their contents
		Gate unit preview displays their skills
	Bugs
		Unit UI shows up even if camera was fiddled with but zoom didn't change
		Follower doesn't preview if you restart after dying
		Enemy tweener can break with fast undo/advance
		Cursor rapid fire on keyboard doesn't work at high FPS
	Game Logic
		Should skills deactivate after everything has acted?
		Resolve ties in ally targeting / enemy action
	QoL
		SP Manual activations indicator when ready
		Default camera position and zoom
		Hovering cursor away from terrain should update cursor, have keyboard jump to nearest available
		Q/E during unit UI moves to the next follower
		Hide clutter in skill description
		Make unit UI more appropriate to each unit
			Don't show terrain on enemies, other stats on nomn-combat units
		Implement camera follows cursor on keyboard
		Implement intents
	Refactors for performance / code cleanness
		Have mugshot regions somewhere central instead of a unit property
		Consolidate healing and attacking code
		Skill descriptions - use parameters instead of hard values and have a get_description() function
		Implement predictive round logic
		Implement delta state saving
	Tutorials
		You can face your units
		Your units can block enemy spawns
		Block range vs attack range

Testing observations:
	Introduce the attack priority of player units somehow
	East-02
		Easier wave of eyes before the hard wave?
		Make it so you can win even if you activate Natasha's skill early?
		Unclear when Dieck activates his skill, do not understand why he survives
		Managed to clear without consciously baiting out attacks with Natasha
	East-03
		Remove the tiles two columns left of summoner? It allows Fredrick to be deployed later
		Spawn more zombies towards the end to make it so you can't clear with Fredrick?
	East-04
		
	Don't know when a skill is activated
	Turn count information
	Fast forward option for advancing turn
	Consider making it so enemies can only bank +1 movement
	
	Consider letting the player play these maps non-linearly
	
	Consider having the enemies' pathing stays even after the gate dies
