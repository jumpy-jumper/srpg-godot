Implementation
	Urgent
		Summoner win skill
		Clicking on units inside gates displays their contents
		Gate unit preview displays their skills
	Bugs
		Frederick facing affects block priority
		Unit UI shows up even if camera was fiddled with but zoom didn't change
		Follower doesn't preview if you restart after dying
		Enemy tweener can break with fast undo/advance
		Cursor rapid fire on keyboard doesn't work at high FPS
	Game Logic
		Should skills deactivate after everything has acted?
		Resolve ties in ally targeting / enemy action
	QoL
		Zooming camera anchors to the clicked position and not the middle
		Q/E during unit UI moves to the next follower
		Hide clutter in skill description
		Make unit UI more appropriate to each unit
			Don't show terrain on enemies, other stats on nomn-combat units
		Implement camera follows cursor on keyboard
		Implement intents
	Refactors for performance / code cleanness
		Have mugshot regions somewhere central instead of a unit property
		Consolidate healing and attacking code
		Skill descriptions - use parameters instead of hard values and have a get_description() function
		Implement predictive round logic
		Implement delta state saving
